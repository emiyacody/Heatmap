# Heatmap
This is the heatmap creation of my course project about prediciton of NYC taxi.
The main code is in visualization.ipynb and main.ipynb.
Visulatization.ipynb finds the connected area in the figure and return them as dict type. Then I manually find all the areas which are in the same area.
Main.ipynb creates the heatmap based on the number of taxi using in each region.
Although the heatmap doesn't look good, it is my best try.
